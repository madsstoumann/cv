	<img src="mads.jpeg" alt="Mads Stoumann" height="200" width="200">

	<h2>Professional Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Hi, I’m Mads!<br>I’m 53, married with two kids, an avid reader, and a
		Lego enthusiast. I’ve spent over 30 years working at the intersection of
		web development, design, and leadership, focusing on creating accessible,
		high-performance web experiences. My career spans from hands-on
		development to mentoring and educating fellow developers. I thrive on
		finding creative solutions, whether building with code or bricks, and am
		passionate about sharing my knowledge with the broader tech community.
	</p>

	<h2>Career Profile</h2>
	<p>
		I started my professional journey at 11, working for Denmark's largest
		comic book publisher, adapting foreign comics for Danish print formats. By
		12, I launched a comics fanzine, editing and publishing over 25 magazines
		and a book on my favorite artist, André Franquin. During high school, I
		organized two exhibitions on comic art and gave a graphic design lecture,
		which sparked my passion for sharing knowledge.
	</p>
	<p>
		My interest in technology was ignited by a VIC-20 computer, which led me
		to manage printed catalogs and later develop an IT system for Copenhagen's
		oldest comic book store. In 1992, I created a Visual Basic app for
		managing products, customers, invoices and subscriptions — an innovation
		that replaced their outdated command-line system. By 1995, I developed the
		store’s first website, which evolved into an e-commerce platform by 1997.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1999, I founded my own company, where I offered a wide range of
		services, including graphic design, web development, app creation, and
		comic book production. During this time, I lettered over 1,000 comic
		books, designed and developed more than 50 websites, and built numerous
		apps. Some of my work was highly specialized, such as the creation of two
		apps for the Danish Health Authority. These apps streamlined processes for
		managing medical paper inventories and calculating vaccination risk
		profiles. My company also designed printed ads, branding materials, and
		logos for a diverse set of clients, ranging from small businesses to large
		organizations.
	</p>
	<p>
		By 2014, my main client was significantly affected by the economic
		downturn, leading me to join Valtech, a leading global web agency. Over
		the next seven years, I grew into the role of Technical Director for
		Frontend Development, where I oversaw large-scale projects and mentored
		teams of developers. I founded and led Valtech’s "Frontend School," a
		global initiative that created an interactive learning environment for
		developers, particularly helping more introverted individuals demonstrate
		their technical abilities. I also specialized in accessibility and
		performance optimization, conducting audits and presenting actionable
		recommendations for websites, informed by my personal experiences with
		Carpal Tunnel syndrome.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2021, I decided to focus on a project that emerged from my time at
		Valtech. I had developed "OneBlock," an extension for the Optimizely
		platform, which allowed non-technical users to build rich, visually
		appealing content components. This tool quickly gained traction and was
		adopted by major companies such as Telia and Coloplast. Eager to explore
		how this concept could be expanded to the burgeoning world of headless CMS
		systems, I co-founded Perfection.dev in 2022. This platform provided a
		visual preview environment for websites using multiple headless sources,
		aimed at simplifying the workflow for content creators and developers
		alike. Despite early success and securing investment, we eventually
		decided to sell the company in 2024 due to slower market adoption of
		headless CMS technology than anticipated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout my career, I’ve maintained a strong passion for sharing
		knowledge. Writing about development and coding remains one of my greatest
		joys, with articles featured on CSS-Tricks, LogRocket, and other
		well-known platforms. My Dev.to page, where I regularly post, has
		attracted over 27,000 followers, and my work is often highlighted in CSS
		newsletters and industry discussions.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to my professional work, I’ve created
		<strong>browser.style</strong>, a CSS library with over 160 components
		that use minimal CSS, support both left-to-right and right-to-left text
		directions, and prioritize accessibility. It’s my passion project,
		something I love working on, as it combines my dedication to simplicity
		and inclusivity in web development.
